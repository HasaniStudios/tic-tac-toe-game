Deliverables:

Basic Server Setup:
Create a server-side application that listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.
Implement a mechanism to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
Log connection and disconnection events.
Client-Side Connection:
Develop a client-side application that can connect to the server.
Implement error handling for failed connection attempts.
Log connection and disconnection events.
Simple Message Exchange:
Establish a basic communication protocol between the server and clients.
Implement functions to send and receive messages.
Test the communication by sending simple messages back and forth.
Error Handling:
Implement basic error handling for network-related issues (e.g., connection timeouts, socket errors).
Log error messages for debugging purposes.
Testing and Debugging:
Test the server's ability to handle multiple client connections.
Verify that clients can connect to the server and exchange messages.
Debug any issues related to network communication or socket operations.
Update README
Include requirements.txt file (only need one per git repository)
This is done within a virtual python environment by running
pip freeze > requirements.txt
